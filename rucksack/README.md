The Knapsack-Problem
--------------------

The Knapsack-Problem tries to optimize a limited capacity for the
highest value possible. The only way to achieve this is by trying
all possible combinations and checking the values. Which makes it
an O(2^n)-Problem. I tried to get a very simple solution which just
O(n)-Complexity which is not mathematical correct (obviously) but
renders a - often - acceptable result and could even be improved
further.
